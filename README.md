## Overview

This project utilizes the following: 
- PHP (5.6.7) on CodeIgniter framework (2.2)
- MySQL 5.5
- Highcharts (JS library for data visualizations)
- jQuery 1.11
- Bootstrap 3


## Planned To-Dos (original dev team is planning on doing most of these)

- Port to Rails
- Make more mobile-friendly
- Fix mobile navigation (on screen shrink) - shift mobile menu to right
- Revamp chat/messaging application
- Clarify User roles - currently the user roles are Admin/Moderator/Regular User/Not approved yet  (‘user_level’ field in users table - 1/2/3/4). This could probably be better.
- Move password hash from md5 to something better
- Users set their own password on ‘request to join’
- Different front-end views depending on user role, generally:
(1) Not Approved Yet: Request/Login screen + Events Page
(2) Regular User: Profile Page (User Dashboard) + Messages + Members + Everything above
(3) Moderator: Create Event + Everything Above
(4) Admin: Admin dashboard + all pages
- Improve Dashboard Charts
- Highcharts functionality
- Cache map on initial load
- Come up with a better, or really any, project name. Some initial attempts:
LANLink,
Lanky,
TeamLinked,
LinkHub,
LinkedTogether,
RescueCentral


## Instructions for Ubuntu Linux
- Unzip htaccess.zip folder included in project root directory. This creates a hidden .htaccess file which allows PHP routes to work properly.

- Setup LAMP
```
sudo apt-get install lamp-server^
```

- Setup MySQL
```
mysql -u root -p password
```

- In MySQL
```
CREATE DATABASE link
```

- Import the provided SQL script dmp to setup the rest of the tables (you could setup the tables manually, but highly recommended to use the SQL script provided)
- (Highly recommended) Install project in /var/www/html
- Install CodeIgniter
- Enable Apache rewire library
```
sudo a2enmod rewrite
sudo service apache2 restart
```

- Modify /etc/apache2/apache2.conf to allow .htaccess, look for this block of code:
```
<Directory /var/www/>
  Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
  AllowOverride None
  Require all granted
</Directory>
```

- Change "AllowOverride None" to "AllowOverride All"

## Instructions for Mac
- Unzip htaccess.zip folder included in project root directory. This creates a hidden .htaccess file which allows PHP routes to work properly.
- Install MAMP
- Import SQL script into your MySQL DB (MySQL Workbench is the tool we used)
- Configure database.php in project /application/config with username/password you setup
